SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**LEFT JOIN:**
```sql
-- Retrieving all customers and their orders (if any)
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**RIGHT JOIN:**
```sql
-- Retrieving all orders and their corresponding customers (if any)
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**FULL JOIN:**

   - Mention that as data changes, indexes may need to be reorganized or rebuilt to maintain efficiency.

**Example:**

Consider a table named "Employees" with columns "EmployeeID," "FirstName," "LastName," "Department," and "Salary."

**Creating an Index:**
```sql
-- Creating an index on the Department column
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON Employees (Department);
```

Explain that creating an index on the "Department" column can significantly speed up queries that involve filtering or searching based on the department.

## 11: Database Transactions and Concurrency Control

**Objective:** In this section, the objective is to introduce the concept of database transactions and concurrency control. We will learn about the ACID properties of transactions, the importance of maintaining data consistency, and techniques to handle multiple concurrent operations.

**Explanation:**

1. **What is a Database Transaction?**
   - Define a transaction as a sequence of one or more database operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that must be executed as a single unit of work.
   - Explain that transactions ensure data integrity and consistency by ensuring that all operations succeed together or fail together.

2. **ACID Properties:**
   - Describe the ACID properties that characterize a reliable database transaction:
     - **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing. Either all operations within a transaction are executed, or none of them are.
     - **Consistency**: Transactions bring the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. Constraints are not violated.
     - **Isolation**: Transactions are executed independently of each other, as if they were executed sequentially.
     - **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive system failures.

3. **Transaction Management:**
   - Learn how to manage transactions using SQL commands, usually `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
   - Explain that `BEGIN TRANSACTION` marks the start of a transaction, `COMMIT` saves the changes, and `ROLLBACK` undoes the changes and aborts the transaction.

4. **Concurrency Control:**
   - Introduce the concept of concurrency, where multiple users or processes may attempt to access and modify the same data simultaneously.
   - Explain that concurrency control techniques are employed to ensure that transactions do not interfere with each other and maintain data consistency.

5. **Concurrency Control Techniques:**
   - Discuss the two primary approaches to concurrency control:
     - **Locking**: Transactions lock the data they are accessing to prevent other transactions from modifying it until they are done.
     - **Isolation Levels**: Define different levels of visibility for uncommitted changes. Common isolation levels include READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE.

6. **Deadlock and Deadlock Prevention:**
   - Define deadlock as a situation where two or more transactions are each waiting for the other to release a lock, leading to a standstill.
   - Discuss techniques for preventing deadlocks, such as lock timeout mechanisms and deadlock detection algorithms.

**Example:**

Consider a scenario where multiple users are attempting to update a shared table "Inventory" with columns "ProductID" and "Quantity" concurrently.

```sql
-- Begin a transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Update the quantity for a product with ID 1001
UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - 5 WHERE ProductID = 1001;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

Explain that if multiple users execute similar transactions simultaneously, concurrency control ensures that the updates occur in an isolated and consistent manner, preventing data inconsistencies.


### Exercises:
1. What are database transactions, and why are they essential for maintaining data integrity?
2. Explain the ACID properties of transactions and their significance in
